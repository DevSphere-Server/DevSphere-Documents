## We Develop with Github
We use github to host all of our public documents.

Pull requests are the best way for you to contribute:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added documents which require location context, add it in a comment.
3. If you've removed documents, or large portions of various documents, add the reason in a comment.
4. Ensure you have no grammar mistakes.
5. Issue that pull request!
